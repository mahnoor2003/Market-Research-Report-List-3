<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Log Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laser</li><li>X-Ray</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 3D log scanner market includes two main types of technologies: laser scanners and X-ray scanners. Laser scanners use laser beams to measure the surface of a log and create a 3D image. They are commonly used for measuring the shape and volume of logs in the forestry industry. X-ray scanners, on the other hand, use X-ray technology to create detailed internal images of logs, providing information about density, internal defects, and moisture content. Both types of scanners are essential for quality control and optimization in the wood processing industry.</p></p>
