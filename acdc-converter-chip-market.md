<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC&DC Converter Chip Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Linear AC DC converters</li><li>SMPS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the AC&DC Converter Chip Market, two main types of converters are linear AC DC converters and SMPS. Linear AC DC converters are simple, reliable, and cost-effective solutions for low power applications. They provide a steady output voltage but are not very efficient. On the other hand, SMPS (Switched-Mode Power Supplies) are more efficient and lightweight, making them ideal for high power applications. They use a switching regulator to convert AC to DC power with higher efficiency and lower heat dissipation.</p></p>
