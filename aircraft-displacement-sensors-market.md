<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Displacement Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Contact Type</li><li>Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft displacement sensors measure the distance or position of aircraft components. The non-contact type uses technologies like ultrasonic, laser, or capacitive sensors to measure without physically touching the surface. This type is ideal for applications where contact may cause damage or disrupt the system. On the other hand, contact type sensors physically touch the surface to measure displacement accurately. They are more suitable for applications where precise measurements are required and where surface conditions allow for physical contact.</p></p>
