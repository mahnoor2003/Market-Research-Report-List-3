<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-static Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Current</li><li>Alternating Current</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Anti-static Device market includes two main types: Direct Current (DC) and Alternating Current (AC). DC anti-static devices are commonly used for smaller electronics and equipment, providing a constant stream of electricity to prevent static buildup. AC anti-static devices are more suitable for larger industrial settings, as they offer a fluctuating current that can cover a wider area. Both types of devices serve the same purpose of reducing static electricity to protect sensitive equipment and prevent damage.</p></p>
