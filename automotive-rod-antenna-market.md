<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Rod Antenna Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Rod Antenna</li><li>Passive Rod Antenna</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active rod antennas are equipped with an active amplifier to enhance the received signal strength, enabling better reception in areas with weak signals. They are generally more expensive but offer superior performance. On the other hand, passive rod antennas do not have an amplifier and rely solely on the antenna's design to capture signals. They are more cost-effective but may not provide the same level of signal amplification as active rod antennas. Both types are commonly used in automotive applications for radio reception.</p></p>
