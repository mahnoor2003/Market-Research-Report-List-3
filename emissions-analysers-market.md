<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Emissions Analysers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-situ</li><li>Extractive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Emissions analysers are used for measuring and analyzing the level of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere. There are two main types of emissions analysers: in-situ and extractive. In-situ analysers measure gases directly at the source of emission, providing real-time data without the need for sample extraction. Extractive analysers, on the other hand, extract a sample of the gas from the emission source and analyze it at a separate location. Both types are essential for monitoring and controlling air pollution in various industries.</p></p>
