<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluorescence Microarray Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-color Detection</li><li>Two-color Detection</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fluorescence microarray scanners are classified into three types based on the detection method used: single-color detection, two-color detection, and others. In single-color detection, only one fluorophore is used to label the target molecules on the microarray. Two-color detection involves using two different fluorophores to tag the target molecules, allowing for simultaneous detection and comparison of different samples. The "others" category may include scanners that use alternative detection methods or a combination of multiple colors for more complex analysis.</p></p>
