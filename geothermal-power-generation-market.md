<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Back Pressure</li><li>Binary</li><li>Double Flash</li><li>Dry Steam</li><li>Single Flash</li><li>Triple Flash</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal power generation can be categorized into various types based on the technology used. The different market types include back pressure, binary, double flash, dry steam, single flash, and triple flash. Back pressure systems utilize hot water or steam to generate power without condensing the steam. Binary systems use a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point to generate power. Double flash, single flash, and triple flash systems flash high-pressure hot water or steam to produce power. Dry steam systems harness steam directly from the ground to generate electricity.</p></p>
