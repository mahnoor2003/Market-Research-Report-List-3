<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Graphene Nanosheets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic</li><li>Hydrophobic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Graphene nanosheets are classified into two main types based on their interaction with water: hydrophilic and hydrophobic. Hydrophilic graphene nanosheets have a high affinity for water molecules, making them easily dispersible in aqueous solutions. On the other hand, hydrophobic graphene nanosheets repel water and prefer non-aqueous solvents. The choice between these types of graphene nanosheets depends on the specific application requirements, with hydrophilic sheets being suitable for applications where water compatibility is needed, while hydrophobic sheets are preferred for non-aqueous environments.</p></p>
