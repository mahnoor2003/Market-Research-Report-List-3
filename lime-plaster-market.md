<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lime Plaster Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrated Lime</li><li>Non-Hydraulic Lime</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lime plaster can be categorized into two main types - hydrated lime and non-hydraulic lime. Hydrated lime is produced by adding water to quicklime, resulting in a chemical reaction that produces calcium hydroxide. This type of lime plaster is commonly used for interior plastering due to its high plasticity and workability. On the other hand, non-hydraulic lime does not have any chemical additives and relies on carbonation for curing. It is commonly used for exterior plastering due to its porosity and breathability.</p></p>
