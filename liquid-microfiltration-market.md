<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Microfiltration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dead End Flow</li><li>Cross Flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid microfiltration market includes two main types: dead end flow and cross flow. </p><p>Dead end flow filtration involves pushing liquid through a filter membrane, trapping particles on the surface. This method is suitable for applications where high filtration efficiency is required for small volumes.</p><p>Cross flow filtration, on the other hand, involves passing liquid across the filter membrane, with a portion of the liquid flowing tangentially across the membrane surface. This method is more suitable for continuous filtration processes with larger volumes. Both methods have their advantages and are used in various industrial applications.</p></p>
