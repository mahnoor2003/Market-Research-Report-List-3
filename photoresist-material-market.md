<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photoresist material is commonly used in the semiconductor and electronics industry for photolithography processes. There are two main types of photoresist material: positive photoresist and negative photoresist. Positive photoresist becomes more soluble when exposed to light, allowing for the desired pattern to be transferred onto the substrate. Negative photoresist, on the other hand, becomes less soluble when exposed to light, resulting in the areas that are exposed to light remaining on the substrate. Both types of photoresist play a crucial role in the manufacturing of electronic components.</p></p>
