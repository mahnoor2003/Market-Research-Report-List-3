<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prism Compressors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Prismatic Pulse Compressors</li><li>Multiple-Prism Pulse Compressor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Prismatic pulse compressors are used for ultrafast pulses in laser systems, where a single prism compresses the pulse in one pass. Multiple-prism pulse compressors use a series of prisms to achieve higher compression ratios, allowing for shorter pulse durations. Both types of compressors are crucial in applications such as ultrafast spectroscopy and micromachining, where precise timing and high peak powers are required. The choice between the two types depends on the specific requirements of the application at hand.</p></p>
