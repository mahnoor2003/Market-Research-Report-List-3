<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Railway Wheel Sets for Freight Wagons Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Forged Wheels</li><li>Casting Wheels</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Railway wheel sets for freight wagons are commonly classified into two main types based on the manufacturing process - forged wheels and casting wheels. Forged wheels are produced by shaping and compressing metal under high pressure, resulting in a strong and durable wheel set. On the other hand, casting wheels are made by pouring molten metal into a mold, which allows for more intricate designs but may not be as strong as forged wheels. Each type caters to different needs and specifications in the railway industry.</p></p>
