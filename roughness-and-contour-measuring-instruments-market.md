<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Roughness and Contour Measuring Instruments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Non-Contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Roughness and contour measuring instruments come in two main market types: contact and non-contact. Contact measuring instruments utilize physical contact with the surface of the object being measured, providing precise results but risking damage to delicate surfaces. Non-contact instruments use sensors or lasers to measure roughness and contour without touching the surface, making them ideal for fragile or sensitive materials. Both types offer unique benefits and cater to different industries and applications based on their specific measurement needs.</p></p>
