<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Electric Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BEV</li><li>PHEV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Small electric vehicles can be categorized into two main types: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). BEVs rely solely on electricity stored in a battery for power, offering zero emissions and operating costs. PHEVs, on the other hand, combine a traditional combustion engine with an electric motor and battery. This allows PHEVs to run on electric power for shorter distances, then switch to the combustion engine for longer trips, offering greater flexibility and reduced range anxiety for consumers.</p></p>
