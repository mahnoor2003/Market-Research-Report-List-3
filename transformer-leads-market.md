<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transformer Leads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Insulated Lead Cable</li><li>Bare Lead Cable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transformer leads market consists of two main types - insulated lead cable and bare lead cable. Insulated lead cable is coated with a protective layer to prevent electrical current leakage and ensure safety. This type is commonly used in indoor applications where protection against moisture and contaminants is necessary. On the other hand, bare lead cable does not have this protective layer and is often used in outdoor settings where exposure to the elements is minimal. Both types play a crucial role in the functioning of transformers.</p></p>
