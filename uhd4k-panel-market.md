<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The UHD4K Panel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LED Technology</li><li>LCD Technology</li></ul></p>
<p><p>UHD4K panels are available in two main market types - LED technology and LCD technology. LED technology utilizes light-emitting diodes to illuminate the screen, resulting in vibrant colors and high contrast ratios. LCD technology, on the other hand, uses liquid crystal displays to block or allow light to pass through, creating images on the screen. Both technologies offer high resolution and clarity, but LED technology typically provides better brightness and energy efficiency compared to LCD technology.</p></p>
